Chrome extension that shows you the contents of removed Facebook messages.

Unsend Recall for Messenger allows you to see the contents of messages that were removed as long as you had Facebook/Messenger open when you received the message. Photo is just an example - it wouldn't work for old messages sent before having the extension installed.
